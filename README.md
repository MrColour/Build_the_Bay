# Build_the_Bay

One week Hackathon at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/), details [here](https://www.42.us.org/42-hosts-first-build-the-bay-hackathon/).

I was part of a 5 man team 'October's Very Own', composed of [Kai Chen](https://github.com/yakuseishou),  [Christopher Ford](https://github.com/Chris7Ford), [Joseph Kaplin](https://github.com/jkaplin), [Kevin Colour](https://github.com/MrColour), and [Aymen Kharroubi](https://github.com/akharrou).

We built the website using MERN stack, **Mango** for the Data Base, **Express** Framework, **React** Frontend and webpages, **Node.js**.

To start our server you should install nodemon and npm. On the root folder start the backend server with `nodemon backend/server.js` then go into the `frontend` directory and run `npm start`. This will run our project on the local host.

I was responsible for some of the front-end elements and gluing the frontend with the backend. This included
writing JS code to retrieve from the backend and then to display on the webpage using React props and also writing the backend code
to send info to the frontend. Testing and writing the entire code to display pictures and video (with audio). Created template code,
JSX to produce components such as the Restaurant id cards, the entire Modal popup. Worked with the css person to create
a consistent and inviting webpage. Polishing some of the rough edges of the frontend. Stayed up all night with the backend guy
to glue and finish various send request for user creation, login, restaurant edit fields to finish just the morning of the presentation.
