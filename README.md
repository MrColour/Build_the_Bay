# Build_the_Bay

One week Hackathon at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/), details [here](https://www.42.us.org/42-hosts-first-build-the-bay-hackathon/).

I was part of a 5 man team 'October's Very Own', composed of [Kai Chen](https://github.com/yakuseishou),  [Christopher Ford](https://github.com/Chris7Ford), [Joseph Kaplin](https://github.com/jkaplin), [Kevin Colour](https://github.com/MrColour), and [Aymen Kharroubi](https://github.com/akharrou).

We built the website using MERN stack, **Mango** for the Data Base, **Express** Framework, **React** Frontend and webpages, **Node.js**.

To start our server you should install nodemon and npm. On the root folder start the backend server with `nodemon backend/server.js` then go into the `frontend` directory and run `npm start`. This will run our project on the local host.
